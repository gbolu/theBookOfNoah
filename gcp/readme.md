# basics
  - GCP: google cloud Platform
  - GCP Resources:
    - physical assets: computers, hard disk drives
    - virtual resources: VMs
    - Google data centers:
      - located in a global region: Central US, w. Europe, E. Asia
      - each reach has multiple zones  which are isolated from each other
        - asia-east1-a
    - global resources:  can be accessed by any other resource, across regions and zones. These global resources include
      - preconfigured disk images,
      - disk snapshots, and
      - networks
    - regional resources: static external IP addresses.
      - , you wouldn't want to attach a disk in one region to a computer in a different region because the latency you'd introduce would make for very poor performance. Thankfully, GCP won't let you do that; disks can only be attached to computers in the same zone.
    - zonal resources: VM instances, their types and disks
  - GCP Projects: Any GCP resources that you allocate and use must belong to a project. You can think of a project as the organizing entity for what you're building
    - project is made up of the settings, permissions, and other metadata that describe your applications
      - A project name, which you provide.
      - A project ID, which you can provide or GCP can provide for you.
      - A project number, which GCP provides.
    - The resources that each project contains remain separate across project boundaries; you can only interconnect them through an external network connection.
  - Services
    -
# services
  - GCP gives you three basic ways to interact with the services and resources.
      - GUI
    - GCP console
    - CLI
      - Google cloud SDK provides gcloud cl tool
      - cloud shell: browser-based interactive shell environment
    - client libraries
      -
## Compute: virtual machines
  - Compute Engine: Virtual Machines
  - App Engine: PaaS for apps and backends
  - Kubernetes engine: containers
  - cloud functions: event driven serverless compute platform
  - Containers & Container Management
  - Functions and Lambdas (serverless)
  -
## storage: files and databases
  - Storing
    - cloud storage for firebase hot files: frequently accessed
    - cloud filestore: cold files: archival
    - Persistent Disk: block storage for VMs: (also a type of hot file)
  - Data Services
    - NoSQL: highly available and eventually consistent
      - cloud bigtable: wide-column db service
      - cloud datastore: nosql document db service
    - RDBMS:
      - Cloud SQL: mysql + postgres
      - cloud spanner:
    - Hadoop & Spark
## Big Data
  - data pipelines: ability to string together different data services as you process data across different workloads
  - data warehouses: very large data storage for read only / infrequently updated enterprise reporting
  - data science notebooks:
    - jupiter notebooks, interactive webpages that allow computation & analysis & visualizations, pairs very well with ML

## other services: networking, ML, etc.
### Identity & Security
  - IM: Identity & Access Permissions
### Management & Monitoring
  - stack driver
### Developer Tools
  - Gcloud: scripting tool
  - IDE Integrations:
    - java
    - visual studio (.net)
## Machine Learning
