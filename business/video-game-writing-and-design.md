## game survival commandments
  - were in the entertainment business, not the game business
  - build your design and story to break
    - multiple technical and production realitities will stress your game design and story, things will be left in the trash bin, get in front of them as fast as possible
  - somebody always knows something you dont
    - learn from everyone you work with
  - dialogue is the tip of the dramatic iceberg
    - throwing dialogue at a broken story never fixes the problem
    - good dialogue and stories come from well-conceived characters in exciting dramatic situations
  - you are only as good as your relationship with your team
  - be willing to kill your babies
    - dont be precious with your ideas, or fall in love with oe particular because it will, almost without fail, be the one on the chopping block
  - protect your vision
    - if you lose your vision for a project or lose what waas meaningful about it that inspired you in the first place, then whats the pont of doing it
  - make your deliverables
    - you are only as good as what you contribute

    - to be playing
