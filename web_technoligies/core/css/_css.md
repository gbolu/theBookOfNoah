# TODO
  - CSS Preprocessor: scripting language that extends CSS and then compiltes it into regular CSS
  -
    -
# TLDR; best practices, tips and tricks
  - always validate your CSS, e.g. with http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
  - always size things from the inside out
  - use `background-clip` to adjust how background-color|image fill its element
  - set the opacity of selected elements and their children via `opacity`
  - `@import` statements must precede all other types of rules except charset and cannot be ussed inside conditional group at-rule
    - in general, review the `import` link above as there are many gotchas
  - review `@font-face` syntax before using them, too many gotchas
  -

# syntax
  - property, e.g. `background-color`
  - value e.g. red in`background-color: red`
  - declaration: property + value e.g. `background-color: red;`
  - declaration block: one/more declarations surrounded by braces e.g. e.g. `{ background-color: red; width: 20px }`
  - rule: selector(s) + declaration block e.g. e.g. `p { background-color: red; }`

# values and units
  - numbers e.g. `20`
  - percentage e.g. `20%`
  - absolute units
    - cm	Centimeters	1cm = 96px/2.54
    - mm	Millimeters	1mm = 1/10th of 1cm
    - Q	Quarter-millimeters	1Q = 1/40th of 1cm
    - in	Inches	1in = 2.54cm = 96px
    - pc	Picas	1pc = 1/16th of 1in
    - pt	Points	1pt = 1/72th of 1in
    - px	Pixels	1px = 1/96th of 1in
  - relative units
    - em	Font size of the parent element.
    - ex	x-height of the element's font.
    - ch	The advance measure (width) of the glyph "0" of the element's font.
    - rem	Font size of the root element.
    - lh	Line height of the element.
    - vw	1% of the viewport's width.
    - vh	1% of the viewport's height.
    - vmin	1% of the viewport's smaller dimension.
    - vmax	1% of the viewport's larger dimension.
  - colors
    - keywords e.g. `red`
    - hexadecimal e.g. `#ff0000`
      - allows us to specify any of the 256 available values for each (16 x 16 = 256.)
    - rgb e.g. `rgb(0,0,255)`
      -  three parameters that represent the red, green and blue channel values of the colors between 0 and 255
    - hsl e.g. hsl(0,100%,50%)
      - accepts hue, saturation, and lightness values, which are used to distinguish between the 16.7 million colors
      - hue: the base shade of the color. This takes a value between 0 and 360, presenting the angles round a color wheel.
      - saturation: how saturated is the color? This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no color (it will appear as a shade of grey), and 100% is full color saturation
      - how light or bright is the color? This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no light (it will appear completely black) and 100% is full light (it will appear completely white)
    - rgba & hsla
      - allow you to set an additional `transparency` dimension
        - `rgba(255,0,0,0.5);`
        - `hsla(240,100%,50%,0.5);`
  - functions e.g. background images / graduates
  - units
    - absolute units
      - px
      - mm
      - cm
      - in
      - pt
      - pc
    - relatice units
      - em: ame as the font-size of the current element
      - ex, ch: the height of a lower case x / width o f the number 0
      - rem: size of the default/root base font-size
      - vw, vh: 1/100th of the width/height of the viewport
    -

# the box model
  - the foundation of layout on the web
    1. content: min/max- width & height
      2. includes both text content & nested child elements
    2. padding: inner margin
    3. border
    4. outline (is not part of the box model, but behaves like the border drawn inside the margin)
    5. margin
  - overflow: when the content of an element overflows its absolute width/height
  - background: box backgrounds (color and images) are stacked on top of eachother
    - background-clip: determines how


# selectors
  - universel selector: selects all elements
  - simple: element type, class, id
  - attirbute: attribute & attribute values; values are case sensitive unless `i` i specified
  - pseudo-classes: based on element state, append keyword to selector
  - pseudo-elements: parts of content in a certain position in relation to an element, e.g. first word of a paragraph or some generated content
  - combinators: ways of combining two/more selectors for a more precise selection
    - `a,b`: matching a or b
    - `a b`: b is descendant of a
    - `a > b`: b is direct child of a
    - `a + b`: b is direct sibling of a
    - `a ~ b`: b is one of a's siblings
  - multiple selectors: applying the same rule to multiple selectors that are separated by commas
    ```css

      :root {}
      p {}
      p.class {}
      p.id {}

      li:active {}
      checkbox:checked {}
      li:first-child {}
      li:last-child {}
      button:enabled {}
      a:hover {}
      input:focus {}
      input:required {}


      [attribute-exists] {}
      [attribute-with='value'] {}
      [attribute-with-case-insensitive='value' i] {}
      [attribute-contains-enum~='value'] {}
      [attribute-contains*='value'] {}
      [attribute-exactly-or-starts-with|='value'] {}
      [attribute-starts-with^='value'] {}
      [attribute-with='value'] {}
      [attribute-ends-with$='value'] {}


      /* All elements with an attribute "href" with values
     starting with "http" will have an arrow added after their
     content (to indicate they are external links) */
      [href^=http]::after {
        content: 'â¤´';
      }
      ::before {}
      ::first-letter {}
      ::first-line {}
      ::selection {}
      ::backdrop {}


    ```

# at-rules
  - used to convey metadata & conditional information e.g. `@IDENTIFIER (RULE);`
    - media query: consits of a media type and zero/more expressions that check for the conditions of particular m edia features
    - page: modify margins, orphans, widows, and page breaks when printing a document
    - font-face: specify a custom font loaded from a remote/server or user's computer
      - most browsers only download `@font-face` fonts if the font-family is actually used in a CSS declaration
        - so list as many as needed, but be careful how many you actually use
      - use `local()` to specify the name of a locally-installed front, useful for offline styling
    - keyframes: controls the intermediate steps ina  CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes/waypoints along the animation sequence
  ```css

    @charset 'UTF-8';
    @import 'custom.css';
    @import 'noahedwardhall.com/styles/poop.css';

    @font-face {
      font-display: auto;

# LAYOUT
## GRID
  - for two dimensional layouts, i.e. requiring rows AND columns

## FLEXBOX
  - one dimensional layout model (columns OR rows) with ease in distributing space between items in an interface


### flexbox layout model
  - flex container: contain flex items, define how flex items are laid out `display: flex`
    - flex line: the imaginary line(s) on which flex items are layed out on the main and cros axis
    - main axis: x axis
      - main start: the beginning of the x-axis
      - main end: the end of the x-axis
    - cross axis: y axis
      - cross start: the start of the y-axis
      - cross end: the end of the x-axis

  - flex items: direct children of flex containers positioned on a flex line
    - main size: size of hte flex item in the dimensioin it's parent flex-container main axis
    - cross size: size of the flex item in the dimension it's parent flex-container cross axis
    -

```css
    .flex-containers {

      display: flex|inline-flex;
      /*
        how flex items are laid out onthe main and cross axis lines
        row: left to right
        row-reverse: main start and end are swapped
        column: main and cross axis are swapped
        column-reverse: same as column, but revered

        flex-end: white space pushed to start of main axis
        center: equal whitespace at start and end of main axis
        space-between: whitespace between items but not at either end of main axis
        space-around: white space between and at ends of main axis

        flex-end: whitespace pushed to start of cross axis
        center: equal whitespace at start and end of cross axis, but not inbetween flex items
        baseline: flex items aligned along their baseline, which is calculated based on the content of each distinct flex item
        stretch: no whitespace, flex items stretched to fill cross axis

# grid
    - CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid"), is a two-dimensional (columns and rows) grid-based layout system
    - define:
      - grid container: `display: grid`
        - the direct parent of all the grid items.
      - grid item: set the column and row sizes with `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`,
      - place grid-item child elements into the grid with
        - `grid-column`
        - `grid-row`
    - grid line: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid
    - grid track: The space between two adjacent grid lines.
    - grid cell: The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It's a single "unit" of the grid.
    - grid area: The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be comprised of any number of grid cells.
