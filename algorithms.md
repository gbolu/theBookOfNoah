# Getting up to speed
  - algorithms are all about finding solutions
    - consider the inputs
      - often require changing the data to match the algorithms requirements
        - it doesnt change the content of the data
        - just the presentation to help you see patterns new patterns that werent apparent before but were actually present in the data all along
    - desired outputs
    - process/sequence of actions used to obtain a desired output fromm a given input
