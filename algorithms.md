# Getting up to speed
  - algorithms are all about finding solutions
    - consider the inputs
      - often require changing the data to match the algorithms requirements
        - it doesnt change the content of the data
        - just the presentation to help you see patterns new patterns that werent apparent before but were actually present in the data all along
    - desired outputs
    - process/sequence of actions used to obtain a desired output fromm a given input

## General terminology
  - `equation` numbers and symbols that, when taken as a whoe, equate to a specific value
    - always contains an equals sign
  - formula - combination of numbers and symbols used to express information or ideas
    - generally show the relationship between two/more variables
  - `algorithm`
    - sequence of steps used to solve a problem
    - `finite`
      - the algorithm must  eventually solve the problem
    - `well-defined`
      - series of steps must be precise and present steps that are understandable
    - `effective` an algorithm must solve all cases of hte problem for which someone defined it
      - failures should be rare and occur only in situations that are acceptable for the intended algorithm use
