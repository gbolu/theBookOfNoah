# Algorithms - background
  - algorithms are all about finding solutions
    - i.e. present methods for solving formulas
    - given a particular input, you should expect a specific output
    - consider the inputs
      - often require changing the data to match the algorithms requirements
        - it doesnt change the content of the data
        - just the presentation to help you see patterns new patterns that werent apparent before but were actually present in the data all along
    - desired outputs
    - process/sequence of actions used to obtain a desired output fromm a given input
  - algorithms can see multiple presentations
    - recursive vs iterative
  - elements of all algorithms
    - describe the problem
    - create a series of steps to solve the problem

## General Use Cases
  - making your day an algorithm that solves the problem of how to live successfully while expending the least amount of energy possible
  -
## General terminology
  - `equation` numbers and symbols that, when taken as a whoe, equate to a specific value
    - always contains an equals sign
  - formula - combination of numbers and symbols used to express information or ideas
    - generally show the relationship between two/more variables
  - `algorithm`
    - sequence of steps used to solve a problem
    - `finite`
      - the algorithm must eventually solve the problem
    - `well-defined`
      - series of steps must be precise and present steps that are understandable
    - `effective` an algorithm must solve all cases of hte problem for which someone defined it
      - failures should bhe inputs
      - often require changing the data to match the algorithms requirements
        - it doesnt change the content of the data
        - just the presentation to help you see patterns new patterns that werent apparent before but were actually present in the data all along
    - desired outputs
    - process/e rare and occur only in situations that are acceptable for the intendsorting ed algorithm use
  - `parallel processing` performing more than one algorithmic step at a time
  - `neural networks`
    - technology that is used to simulate human thought and make deep learning tehcniques possible for machine learning scenarios

## other things
  - GPUs are commonly used chips for perming algorithm-related tasks
    - specialize in providing support for math-intensive tasks, especially those that involve data transformations
  - using multiple cores makes parallel processing possible
  -
## Types of algorithms
  - searching
    - locating information or verifying that the information you see is the information you want
    - use cases
      - finding a website
  - sorting
    - determining which order to use to present information
    - many algoirthms require data in the proper order to work dependably
    - use cases
  - transforming
    - converting on sort of data to another sort of data
    - use cases
      - understanding and using data effectively
  - scheduling
    - making the use of  resources fair to all concerned
    - use cases
      - traffic lights
      - parallel processing
  - graph analysis
    - deciding on the shortest line between two points
    - use cases
      - GPS
  - cryptography
    - analyze data, put it into some other form and then return it to its orginal form later
    - use cases
      - security

# running algorithms
  - `cluster computing`
    - network computers together using special software
    - a master computer can use the the processors of slave computers running an agent
      - agent - a kind of in memory backgorund application that makes the processor available
    - offload pieces of th eproblem to a number of slave copmuters
    - as each computer in the network solves its part of th eproblem, it sends the results back to the master,
    - the master then puts the pieces together to create a consolidated answer
