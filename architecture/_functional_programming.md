# books 
	- function programming in javascript 
	- 	Luis Atencio


# develoepr perspective  
	- gravitate towards framworks that help us create extensib  le and clean application architectures 

# terminology 
	- object oriented design 

# programming paradigms
	- reactive programming 
		- facilitates working with data flow and propagation of change 
		- extremely importaant ahen delaing with asynchronous or event based code 
	- functional programming 
		- a way of writing code (and nothing else) 
		- a software development style that places a major emphasis on the use of functions 
		- purpose is to dabstract control flows and operations on data with fucntions in ordder to avoid side effects and reduce mutation of state in an applicaations 
	- object oriented programming


# application design 
	- extensibility 
		-	do i constantly refactor my code to support additional functiooonality 
	-	easy to modularize
		-	if i change one file, is nother file affected 
	- reusability 
		- is there a lot fo duplication 
	-	testability 
		-	do i strugglle to unit test my fucntions 
	-	easy to reason about 
		-	is my code unstructured and har dto follow '



# function vs object oriented design 


# function programming concepts 
	- parameterized functions 
		- parametrers arent just scalar values but can/and should be funjctioons themselves
	- decomposition 
		- breaking down ap rogrmaa into smaller pieces that are more reusable, reliable, and easier to understand 
	- composition 
		- recomposing/combining indiviudal functions to form an entire program that is easier to reason about as a whole
