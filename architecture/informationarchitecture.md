# terminology
  - information architecture
    - the structural design of shared information environments
    - the combination of organization, labeling, search and navigation systems wtihin websites and intranets
    - the art and science of shaping information products and experiences to support usability and finability
    - an emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing principles of designn and architecture to the digital landscape
    - our understanding of the world is largely determined by our ability to organize information
    -

  - information
    - to distinguish information architecture from data and knowledge management
    - data - facts and figures
    - knowledge - stuff in peoples heads
  - relational databases
    - highly structured and produce specific answers to specific questions
  - metadata
    - terms used to describe and represent content objects such as documents, people, processes and organizatinons
  - websites
    - components
      - main page, navigation bar, links, content pages, sitemap, site index, search etc
    - dimensions
      - multidimensional information space with hypertextual navigation
    - boundaries
      - fairly intangible with fuzzy borders that bleed information into other sites
    - purpose
      - provide access to content, sell prodcts, enable transactions, facilitate collaboration, etc
    - heterogeneity
      - huge diversity of media types, documdnts, and file formats
    - centralization
      - often very decentralized operations, with subsites maintained independently
      -

# knowledge management
  - develop tools, processes and incentives to encourage people to share that stuff
  - tackling tough issues surrounding corporate culture such as
    - informatino hoarding
    - not-invent-here syndrom

# information architects
  - main goals
    - organize huge amounts of information so that people can actually find what theyre looking for, lol an internet librarian
    - make it easy for customers to find products, a kind of one-to-one marketing
    - takes on the information overload problem that everyones always complaining about
    - portrays a snapshot/spatial view of an information system
    - focus on making content and knowledge more accessible
    - do your best to learn about users major information needs and information seeking behaviors
      - a better understanding of what users actually want from your site will help you determine and prioritize which architectual components to build
    - structuring
      - involves determining the appropriate elevels of granularity for the information atoms in your site and deciding how to relate them to one another
    - organizing
      - involves grouping those components into meaningful and distinctive ategories
    - labeling
      - means figuring out what to call those categories and the series of navigation links that lead to them
    - findability
      - critifal success factor for overall usability
      - if users can find what they need through some combiantion of browsing, searching and asking then the site fails
      - tools
        - taxonoomies
        - search engines
    - managing information
      - must balance the needs of users with the goals of the business
      - efficient content management and clear policies and procedures are essential
    - art and science
      - the practice of information architecture has lots of ambiguity and complexity
  - what its NOT
    - graphic design
    - software devlopment
    - usability engineering
  - main tasks
    - creation of categories
    - choice of labels
    - rely on developers to bring their ideas to fruition
## challenges
  - ambiguity
    - classification systems are built upon the foundation of language and language is ambiguous
    - words are capable of being understood more than one way
    - not only do we need to agree on the labels and their definitions we also need to agree on which documents to place in which categories
  - heterogeneity
    - refers to an object or collection of objects composed of unrelated or unlike parts
    - makes it difficult to impose any single structured organization system on the content
    - homogeneous
      - refers to something composed of similar or identical elements
  - internal politics
    - you have to be sensitive to your organizations political environment

## specializations

    - have important skills related to 'bottom-up' processes
    - excellent at modeling content and metadata for inclusion in a database or content management system
    - great at figuring out how all of the component systems and technologies of an information architecture fit together
  - technical writing
    - spend time writing technical documentation/developing online help systems
    - deep understanding to both the needs of users and the potential for structuring, labeling and describing textual content

  - product management
    - understand how to tap the motivations and talents of a diverse group oof professionals
    - very effective in the areas of strategy formation and interdisciplinary team management


## costs and value propositions
  - cost of finding information
    - if you can save every employee X minutes per day struggling to find answers on your intranet
    - cost of frustrating your customers with a poorly organized site
  - cost oof not finding information
    - how many bad decisions are made every day inn your organization because employees didnt find the information they needed
      - how much duplication of efforts results from this disconnect
    - how many customers did you lose because they cant find the product they want
    - how much do you spend on customer support because existing customers hate navigating yoru technical-support database
  - value of education
    - the value of educating yoru customers about new prodcuts and services related to the ones theyre actively seekinng
  - cost of constructioon
    - what does it cost to design and build a website
    - how much does it cost to redo it six months later because it didnt support findability or doesnt scale
  - cost of maintenance
    - what does it cost to ensure that good designs dont crumble over time
    - will the people who maintain the site know where to put new content and when to remove outdated content
  - cost of training
    - what does it cost to train employees to use your system
    - how much could you save if it wasnt so complicated to use
  - value of brand
    - no matter how beautiful your website is
      - if customers cant find what they need, your brand loses value

## IA concepts
  - complex systems are a mix of content, context and users
    - form the basis of the IA model for practicing effective information architecture design
    - you cant design useful information architectures in a vacuum
      - need to understand the business goals behind the website
      - the resources available for the design and implementation
      - be aware of the nature and volume of content that exists
        - and how it may change a year from now
      - learn about the needs and information seeking behaviors of the sites major audiences
  - IA is often invisible work
    - the interface is the tip of the pyramid
    - infromation architecture is the foundation of the interface
  - knowledge networks
    - IA creates documents to connect people with content

### content
  - broadly inclues documents, applications, services, schema, and metadata that people need to use or find on your site
  - volume
    - how much content exists
    - how many applications
    - how many pages
    - how many documents
    - i.e. how big is your site
  - dynamism
    - what is the rate of growth/turnover
    - how much new content will be added next year
    - how quickly will content go stale ?
  - existing structure
  - ownership
    - who creates and owns the content
    - is ownership centralized within a content authoring group
    - is ownership distributed among functional departments
    - how much content is licensed from external information vendors
  - format (of content/information)
    - document/data types
    - databases
    - product catalogs
    - PDF
    - video
    - etc
  - structure (information is organized/ranked/etc)
    - all documents are not created equal
    - an important memo may be fewer than 100 worods
    - a technical manual may be mmore than 1000 pages
  - metadata
    - to what extend has metadata that describes the content and objects within your site already been created
    - have documents been tagged manually or automatically
    - whats the level of quality and consistency
    - is there a controlled vocabulary
    - are users permitted to supply their own folksonomic tags to content
    - heavily impacts both information retrieval and content management


### context
  - all websites and intranets exist within a particular business/organizational context
    - mission statement
    - strategy
    - staff
    - processes and procedures
    - physical and technology infrastructure
    - budget
    - business goals
    - funding
    - politics
    - culture
    - technology
    - resources
    - constraints
  - the vocabulary and structure of your site is a major component of the evolving conversation between your business and your customers and employees
  - provides a tangible snapshot of your organizations mission, vision, values, strategy and culture

### users
  - differences in customer preferences and behaviors within the physical world translate into different information needs and information seeking behaviors in the context of websites
    - do you know whos using your site?
    - how theyre using it?
    - what information they want from your site?
  - to think about
    - audience
    - tasks
    - needs
    - information seeking behavior
    - experience
  - goals
    - start with users and the reason they come to a site in the first place
      - they have an information need
      - information needs can vary widely, and each type of informatioo need causes users to exhibit specific information seeking behaviors
        - seeking something you need (e.g. a phone number) is far different information need that learning about a topic
        - searching for something you know is very different behavior that browsing for the unknown
        - your designs should reflect this difference


#### researching users information needs and seeking behaviors
  - bottom up information architecture
    - by supporting searching and browsing, the structure inherent in content enables the answers to users questions to rise to the surface
    - content structure, sequencing and tagging
    - answers the following questions
      - where am i
      - whats here
      - where can i go from here
    - is important because users are increasingly likey to bypass your sites top down information architecture
      - using websites and tools like google search
      - click through ads
      - clicking links while reading your content via their aggregators
        - for all the aforementioned reasons, you need bottom up informatioon architectgure
  - top down information architecture
    - anticipating users information needs and building off those assumptions
    - determine the most common questions and design the site to meet those needs
      - where am I
      - i know what im looking for; how do I search for it
      - how do I get around this sites
      - whats important and unique about this organization
      - whats available on this site
      - whats happening there
      - do they want my opinion about their site
      - how can I contact a human
      - whats their address
  - search analytics
    - based on a high volume of real user data
      - however it doesnt provide an opportunity to interact with users and learn more about their needs directly
    - involves reviewing the most common search queries on your site to diagnose problems with
      - search performance
      - metadata
      - navigation
      - content
    - researching log files
    - provides a sense of what users commonly seek and can help inform your understanding of their information needs and seeking behaviors
    - useful for developing task analysis exercises
  - contextual inquiry
    - a user research method with roots in ethnography
    - allows you to observe how users interact with information in their natural settings
    - ask users why there are doing what they are doing while they are doing it
  - task analysis
  - surveys
  - focus groups

#### information needs
  - users are essentially looking for ideas and concepts that inform us and help us make decisions

  - known-item seeking, i.e. the perfect catch
    - you know what youre looking for, what to call it, and wheere youll find it
    - e.g.
      - what is the population of san francisco
    -

  - exploratory seeking, i.e. lobster trapping
    - is usually open-ended, there is no clear expectation of a 'right' answer,
      - nor do you know how to truly articulate what youre looking for
        - if you did, it would be known-item seeking
    - your not exactly sure what your looking for
      - in reality your looking to learn something from the process of searching and browsing
    - when youre looking for more than just a single answer
    - you dont really know much about what youre looking for and arent ready to commit to retrieving anything more than just a few useful items/suggestions of where to learn more
    - you hope that whatever you find will be useful and if it is, thats good enough
    - e.g.
      - find out about good bed and breakfasts inns in some city
      - you want to learn something new about some topic
      - you need to get a sense of what sort of financial plans can help you save for retirement

  - exhaustive research, i.e. indiscriminate driftnetting
    - you want to leave no stone unturned in your search for information on a topic
    - you want to know everything about a topic
    - you usually have many weays to express what your looking for,
    - hopefully you have the patience to construct a search using all the various terms
    - e.g.
      - research for a doctoral thesis
      - performing comopetitive intelligence analysis
      - learning about some medical condition
  - re-finding, i.e. ive seen you before, moby dick
    - information that youd prefer to never lose track of,
    - youll bookmark it so you can find it again

#### information seeking behaviors
  - information seeking behavior
    - users iteratively search, ask, browse, repeat
      - enter queries in search systems
      - browse from link to link
      - ask humans for help
        - email, chat interfaces, etc
    - you must undestand information needs and information seeking behaviors
      - your designs/architecture should reflect your understanding
    - integration
      - often integrate searching, browsing and asking in the same finding session
    - iteration
      - we dont always get things right the first time
      - our information needs may change along the way, causing us to try new approaches with each new iteration


## information models
  - modeling users needs and behaviors forces us to ask questions about
    - what kind of information the user wants,
    - how much information is enough
    - how the user actually interacts with the architecture

  - too-simple model
    - algorithm
      1. user asks a question
      2. something happens (e.g. searching/browsing)
      3. user receives the answer
      4. done
    - issues
      - users rarely find what there looking for (especially if they are browsing)
      - users often complete their efforts at finding information in a state of partial satisfaction/outright frustration
        - I was able to find information on X, but I was really looking for Y
          - X may satisfy the users needs somewhat, but it still wasnt the perfect solution
      - only focuses on what happens while the user is interacting with the information architecture
        - ignores the information needs context
          - all the related stuff that happens before and after the user ever touches the keyboard
        - assumes an ignorant user who brings llittle/any prior knowledge to the table
    - use cases
      - when users know what there looking for

  - berry picking model
    - users start with an information need
    - formulate an information request (i.e. query)
    - move iteratively through an information system along potentially complex paths, picking bits of information (i.e. berries) along the way
    - in the process they modify their information requests as they learn more about what they need and what information is available from the system
    - supporting users with berry picking information needs
      - look for ways to support moving easily from search to browse and back again
      - ability to search within the subcategories you find through browsing
      - browse through categires you find by searching

  - pearl growing model
    - users start with one or a few good documents that are exactly what they need
    - they want to get 'more like this one'
    - supporting users with pearl growing information needs
      - allow users to do just that, provide a command called 'similar pages' next to each search result
      - allow users to link from a 'good' document to documents indexed with the same keywords
      - allow users to navigate to items that share somethign in common

  - two step model
    - when users are confronted with a site consisting of links to perhaps hundreds of departmental subsites
    - step one
      - users first need to know where to look for the information they need
      - they might search or browse through a directory until they find a good candidate or two
    - step two
      - looking for information within those subsites
    - the users information seeking behavior may be radically different for each of these two steps
      - the information architectures typically of portals are usually nothing like those of departmental subsites

## visualing information architecture
  - the sites visual designs
  - colors
  - typeface images
  - information design
    - number of columns
    - column widths
    - changes throughout
  - interaction design
    - mouseovers
    - pull-down menus
    -
## deliverables
### major components
#### organization systems
  - organization is closely related to navigation, labeling and indexing
    - hierarchical organization structures often play the part of primary navigation systems
  - how you categorize information and organize content
    - aka taxonomies/hierarchies
    - present the sites information to us in a variety of ways
    - the main ways of categorizing or grouping a sites content
      - by topic
      - by task
      - by audiences
      - by chronology

  - components
    - organization schemes
      - defines the shared characteristics of content items and influences the logical grouping of those items
      - exact/objective organization scheme
        - divide information into well-defined and mutually exclusive sections
        - require users to know what theyre looking for
        - easy to design and maintain because there is little intellectual work involved in assigning items to categories
        - alphabetical
          - primary organization scheme for enclyopedias and dictionaries
          - e.g.
            - alphabetical organization of a phone books white pages
            - department store directories, bookstores, libraries
          - often serve as an umbrella for other organization schemes
        - chronological
          - organized by date
    - organization structures
      - defines the types of relationships between content items and groups

  - browsing aids
    - present users with a predetermined set of paths to help them navigate the site
    - users navigate your site through menus and links instead of search
  - tag clouds
  - metadata tagging / manual tagging
    - tool for organizing content items into groups at a very detailed level

#### labeling systems
  - how you represent the categories and content created by organization systems
    - e.g. scientific terminology 'acer' or lay terminology 'maple'
  - language should be meaningful to users
    - categories
    - options
    - links
  - play  a significant role in defining the contents of categories

#### navigation systems
- how we browse or move through information
    - e.g. clicking through a hierarchy
  - help users move through the content
  - site wide navigation systems
    - primary navigation systems that help users understand where they are and where they can go within a site
    - e.g. breadcrumbs
  - local navigation systems
    - primary navigation systems that help users understand where they are and where they can go within a portion of a site
    - e.g. subsite
  - sitemaps/tables of contents
    - navigation systems that supplement primary navigation systems
    - provide a condensed overview of and links to major content areas and subsites within the site
    - usually in outline fora site
    - e.g. breadcrumsm
  - site indeces
    - supplementtary navigation systems that provide an alphabetized list of links to the contents of the site
  - site guides
    - supplementary navigation systems that lead users through a sequential set of steps
    - may also link to a related subset of the sites content
  - site wizards
    - supplementary navigation systems that lead users through a sequential set of steps
    - may also link to a related subset of the sites content
  - contextual navigation systems
    - consistently presented links to related content
    - often embedded in text
    - generally used to connect highly specialized content within a site

#### searching systems
  - allow entry of a user-defined query and automatically present users with a customized set of results
  - dynamically and mostly automated counterparts to browsing aid
  - configured to index and search certain parts of the site
  - to display certain kinds of information in each search result
    - page title, extract, date, etc.
    - to handle searc  - controlled vocabulariesh queries in certain ways
      - removing 'stop words'
        - e.g. a, the, and, of
    - 'best link' and other types of manually data that are attached to automated search results

  - search interface
    - the means of entering and revising a search query
    - typically with
      - information on how to improve your query
      - seleting from specific search zones
      - etc
  - query language
    - the grammar of a search query
    - typically includes
      - boolean operators (AND/OR/NOT)
      - proximity operators (ADJACENT/NEAR)
      - ways of specifying which field to search (AUTHOR,NAME)
  - query builders
    - ways of enhancing a querys performance
    - e.g. spell checkers, stemming, concept searching, drawing in synonyms from a thesaurus
  - retrieval algorithms
    - the part of a search engine that determines which content matches a users query
    - e.g. google pagerank
  - search zones
    - subsets of site content that have been separately indexed to support narrower searching
    - e.g. searching just the tech support area
  - search results
    - presentation of content that matches the users search query
    - involves decisions of
      - what types of content that should make up each individual result
      - how many results to display
      - how sets of results should be ranked, sorted and clustered

#### content and tasks
  - the users ultimate destinations, as opposed to separate components that get users to their desitinations
  - headings
    - labels for the content that follows them
  - embedded links
    - links within text, these label (i.e. represent) the content they link to
  - embedded metadata
    - information that can be used as metadata but must first be extracted
    - e.g. in a recipe, the ingredients can be indexed to support searching by ingredient
  - chunks
    - logical units of content
    - can vary in granularity
      - e.g. sectinos and chapters are both chunks
    - can be nested
      - e.g. section is part of a book
  - lists
    - groups of chunks or links to chunks
    - are important because
      - theyve been grouped together (share  some trait in common)
      - have been presented in a particular order (e.g. chronologically)
  - sequential aids
    - clues that suggest
      - where the user is in a process or task
      - how far he has to go before completing it
  - identifiers
    - clues that suggest where the user is in an information system
    - e.g.
      - logo specifying what site she is using
      - breadcrumb explaining where in the site she is

#### invisible components
  - certain key architectural components are manifest completely in the background
  - users rarely (if ever) interact with them
  - often 'feed' other components
    - e.g. a thesaurus used to enhance a search query
  - controlled vocabularies
    - predetermined vocabularies of preferred terms that describe a specific domain
      - e.g. auto racing/orthopedic surgery
    - typically include variant terms
      - e.g. 'brewskie' for 'beer'
    - thesauri
      - controlled vocabularies that generally include linkis to browser and narrower terms, related terms and descriptions of preferred terms (aka scope notes)
  - retrieval algorithms
    - used to rank search results by relevance
    - reflect their pgrogrammers judgments on how to determine relevance
  - best bets
    - preferred search results that are manually coupled with a search query
    - editors and subject matter experts determine
      - queries should retrieve best bets
      - which documents merit best bet status

    - menus with appropriate labels
  - manipulate the content for better browsing
    - sorting
    - tag clouds

-

# high level
  - how a website is structured
## related fields
  - human-coomputer interaction
  - user research
  - usability engineering

# users
  - users focus on tasks, not on structure
    - but its because users dont are about the structure of a web ssite that it is so important to get the information architecture right in the design

# design
  - the more often that answers are located in the places you look for them
