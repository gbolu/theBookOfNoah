# terminology
  - information architecture
    - the structural design of shared information environments
    - the combination of organization, labeling, search and navigation systems wtihin websites and itnranets
    - the art and science of shaping information products and experiences to support usability and finability
    - an emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing principles of designn and architecture to the digital landscape
  - information
    - to distinguish information architecture from data and knowledge management
    - data - facts and figures
    - knowledge - stuff in peoples heads
  - relational databases
    - highly structured and produce specific answers to specific questions
  - metadata
    - terms used to describe and represent content objects such as documents, people, processes and organizatinons
  - websites
    - components
      - main page, navigation bar, links, content pages, sitemap, site index, search etc
    - dimensions
      - multidimensional information space with hypertextual navigation
    - boundaries
      - fairly intangible with fuzzy borders that bleed information into other sites
    - purpose
      - provide access to content, sell prodcts, enable transactions, facilitate collaboration, etc
    - heterogeneity
      - huge diversity of media types, documdnts, and file formats
    - centralization
      - often very decentralized operations, with subsites maintained independently
      -

# knowledge management
  - develop tools, processes and incentives to encourage people to share that stuff
  - tackling tough issues surrounding corporate culture such as
    - informatino hoarding
    - not-invent-here syndrom


# information architects
  - main goals
    - organize huge amounts of information so that people can actually find what theyre looking for, lol an internet librarian
    - make it eaasy for customers to find products, a kind of one-to-one marketing
    - takes on the information overload problemt hat everyones always complaining about
    - portrays a snapshot/spatial view of an information system
    - focus on making content and knowledge more accessible
    - structuring
      - involves determining the appropriate elevels of granularity for the information atoms in your site and deciding how to relate them to one another
    - organizing
      - involves grouping those components into meaningful and distinctive ategories
    - labeling
      - means figuring out what to call those categories and the series of navigation links that lead to them
    - findability
      - critifal success factor for overall usability
      - if users can find what they need through some combiantion of browsing, searching and asking then the site fails
      - tools
        - taxonoomies
        - search engines
    - managing information
      - must balance the needs of users with the goals of the business
      - efficient content management and clear policies and procedures are essential
    - art and science
      - the practice of information architecture has lots of ambiguity and complexity
  - what its NOT
    - graphic design
    - software devlopment
    - usability engineering
  - main tasks
    - creation of categories
    - choice of labels
    - rely on developers to bring their ideas to fruition

    - great at figuring out how all of the component systems and technologies of an information architecture fit together
  - technical writing
    - spend time writing technical documentation/developing online help systems
    - deep understanding to both the needs of users and the potential for structuring, labeling and describing textual content

## costs and value propositioons
  - cost of finding information
    - if you can save every employee X minutes per day struggling to find answers on your intranet
    - cost of frustrating your customers with a poorly organized site
  - cost oof not finding information
    - how many bad decisions are made every day inn your organization because employees didnt find the information they needed
      - how much duplication of efforts results from this disconnect
    - how many customers did you lose because they cant find the product they want
    - how much do you spend on customer support because existing customers hate navigating yoru technical-support database
  - value of education
    - the value of educating yoru customers about new prodcuts and services related to the ones theyre actively seekinng
  - cost of constructioon
    - what does it cost to design and build a website
    - how much does it cost to redo it six months later because it didnt support findability or doesnt scale
  - cost of maintenance
    - what does it cost to ensure that good designs dont crumble over time
    - will the people who maintain the site know where to put new content and when to remove outdated content
  - cost of training
    - what does it cost to train employees to use your system
    - how much could you save if it wasnt so complicated to use
  - value of brand
    - no matter how beautiful your website is
      - if customers cant find what they need, your brand loses value
## IA concepts
  - complex systems are a mix of content, context and users
    - form the basis of the IA model for practicing effective information architecture design
    - you cant design useful information architectures in a vacuum
      - need to understand the business goals behind the website
      - the resources available for the design and implementation
      - be aware of the nature and volume of content that exists
        - and how it may change a year from now
      - learn about the needs and information seeking behaviors of the sites major audiences
  - IA is often invisible work
    - the interface is the tip of the pyramid
    - infromation architecture is the foundation of the interface
  - knowledge networks
    - IA creates documents to connect people with content

### content
  - broadly inclues documents, applications, services, schema, and metadata that people need to use or find on your site
  - volume
    - how much content exists
    - how many applications
    - how many pages
    - how many documents
    - i.e. how big is your site
  - dynamism
    - what is the rate of growth/turnover
    - how much new content will be added next year
    - how quickly will content go stale ?
  - existing structure
  - ownership
    - who creates and owns the content
    - is ownership centralized within a content authoring group
    - is ownership distributed among functional departments
    - how much content is licensed from external information vendors
  - format (of content/information)
    - document/data types
    - databases
    - product catalogs
    - PDF
    - video
    - etc
  - structure (information is organized/ranked/etc)
    - all documents are not created equal
    - an important memo may be fewer than 100 worods
    - a technical manual may be mmore than 1000 pages
  - metadata
    - to what extend has metadata that describes the content and objects within your site already been created
    - have documents been tagged manually or automatically
    - whats the level of quality and consistency
    - is there a controlled vocabulary
    - are users permitted to supply their own folksonomic tags to content
    - heavily impacts both information retrieval and content management
    -
### context
  - all websites and intranets exist within a particular business/organizational context
    - mission statement
    - strategy
    - staff
    - processes and procedures
    - physical and technology infrastructure
    - budget
    - business goals
    - funding
    - politics
    - culture
    - technology
    - resources
    - constraints
  - the vocabulary and structure of your site is a major component of the evolving conversation between your business and your customers and employees
  - provides a tangible snapshot of your organizations mission, vision, values, strategy and culture

### users
  - differences in customer preferences and behaviors within the physical world translate into different information needs and information seeking behaviors in the context of websites
    - do you know whos using your site?
    - how theyre using it?
    - what information they want from your site?
  - to think about
    - audience
    - tasks
    - needs
    - information seeking behavior
    - experience
  - goals
    - start with users and the reason they come to a site in the first place
      - they have an information need
      - information needs can vary widely, and each type of informatioo need causes users to exhibit specific information seeking behaviors
        - seeking something you need (e.g. a phone number) is far different information need that learning about a topic
        - searching for something you know is very different behavior that browsing for the unknown
        - your designs should reflect this difference
    - information seeking behavior
      - users iteravily search, ask, browse, repeat
      - you must undestand information needs and information seeking behaviors
        - your designs/architecture should reflect your understanding

#### information needs
  - users are essentially looking for ideas and concepts that inform us and help us make decisions

  - known-item seeking, i.e. the perfect catch
    - you know what youre looking for, what to call it, and wheere youll find it
    - e.g.
      - what is the population of san francisco

  - exploratory seeking, i.e. lobster trapping
    - is usually open-ended, there is no clear expectation of a 'right' answer,
      - nor do you know how to truly articulate what youre looking for
        - if you did, it would be known-item seeking
    - your not exactly sure what your looking for
      - in reality your looking to learn something from the process of searching and browsing
    - when youre looking for more than just a single answer
    - you dont really know much about what youre looking for and arent ready to commit to retrieving anything more than just a few useful items/suggestions of where to learn more
    - you hope that whatever you find will be useful and if it is, thats good enough
    - e.g.
      - find out about good bed and breakfasts inns in some city
      - you want to learn something new about some topic
      - you need to get a sense of what sort of financial plans can help you save for retirement

  - exhaustive research, i.e. indiscriminate driftnetting
    - you want to leave no stone unturned in your search for information on a topic
    - you want to know everything about a topic
    - you usually have many weays to express what your looking for,
    - hopefully you have the patience to construct a search using all the various terms
    - e.g.
      - research for a doctoral thesis
      - performing comopetitive intelligence analysis
      - learning about some medical condition
  - re-finding, i.e. ive seen you before, moby dick
    - information that youd prefer to never lose track of,
    - youll bookmark it so you can find it again

#### information seeking behaviors
  -
## information models
  - modeling users needs and behaviors forces us to ask questions about
    - what kind of information the user wants,
    - how much information is enough
    - how the user actually interacts with the architecture
  - too-simple model
    - algorithm
      1. user asks a question
      2. something happens (e.g. searching/browsing)
      3. user receives the answer
      4. done
    - issues
      - users rarely find what there looking for (especially if they are browsing)
      - users often complete their efforts at finding information in a state of partial satisfaction/outright frustration
        - I was able to find information on X, but I was really looking for Y
          - X may satisfy the users needs somewhat, but it still wasnt the perfect solution
      - only focuses on what happens while the user is interacting with the information architecture
        - ignores the information needs context
          - all the related stuff that happens before and after the user ever touches the keyboard
        - assumes an ignorant user who brings llittle/any prior knowledge to the table
    - use cases
      - when users know what there looking for
  -

-

# high level
  - how a website is structured
## related fields
  - human-coomputer interaction
  - user research
  - usability engineering

# users
  - users focus on tasks, not on structure
    - but its because users dont are about the structure of a web ssite that it is so important to get the information architecture right in the design

# design
  - the more often that answers are located in the places you look for them
    - the easier the design will feel to users
    - the more successful the project
    - more sales for ecommerce sites
    - better reputation for good service (marketing sites)
    - less loss of productivity (for intranets)
  -
# usability
  - the very first step is to get to the correct page , and if that fails the entire site might as well not exist
  - common problems
    - search and finability problems
    - page design
    - content usability
    - task support
