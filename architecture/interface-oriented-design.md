# terminology
  - polymorphism
    - using the same interface but with potentially different implementations


# interfaces
  - defs
    - applies to a set of method signatures (names and parameter lists)
    - a set of funtions that apply toa  common concept, such as a set of functions that operate on a file
  - textual interface
    - specifies the functions to perform, e.g. the command prompt


  - examples
    - Unix device interface
      - hard drives, displays, printers, keyboards and files all use the same interface
      - is an example of polymorphism in a non-object oriented language
      - to the user, each device has an entry in the file system in the `/dev` dir
