# need to research
  - [hyperloglog](https://redis.io/commands/#hyperloglog): used to count big data, uses maybe 100x less memory than regular redis data times
    + is a counter
    + cardinality: 98% correctness on counting big data
    + example: I get 20k new subscribers every hour, how many subscribers do I have that joined in the last 12 months?
    + commands begin with pf
