# books
  - nginx from beginner to pro
    - rahul soni

# terminology
  - http
    - hypertext transfer protocol
    - a set of rules for transferring files
    - a language in which a server and client communicate
  - servers
    - web server
      - a server that hosts an application that listens to the HTTP requests
      - responsible for listening for and responding to http requests
    - proxy server
      - reverse proxy server
        - retrieves resources from other servers on behalf of a client
  - media streaming
    - http streaming
      - when a viewer clicks play and the media startings playing after an intial amount of buffering
      - backend software ensures that the data rate of the encoded file is less than that of the bandwidth
      - no media is stored on the client
    - http progressive download
      - enables you to use simple http web servers
      - the media that is delivered is typically stored at the client side and played directly from the hard drive
      - since the data is stored locally before playing the user experience is a lot better than streaming
    - http adaptive streaming
      - automatically adapts to the clients bandwidth
      - when the connection is good the viewer gets higher quality content
      - when the connection quality deterorates, a lower data rate is opted for
      - requires dedicated streaming software

# nginx
  - use cases
    - free, open source server
      - reverse proxy first, web server second
      - imap/pop3/smtp proxy
      - websocket
      - http(s), SPDY
    - event based reverse proxy
      - routes each request based on the URI
      - accelerate existing applicaations
        - put nginx infront of an existing set of web servers and let it take care of routing traffic to the back end intelligently
    - load balancer
      - ssl termination
        - ssl induces an extra processing overhead on the server side where it has to decrypt the request everytime
        - instead, each request arrives to the load balancer on a secure channel but will be sent to backend servers without SSL
          - webservers react faster and the response still returns to the clients in a secure manner
    - serving static files
      - not suited for serving dynamic files
    - video streaming mp4/flv/hds/hls
      - used to deliver video content via progressive downloads
    - monitoring and logging
    - nginx plus features
      - available only in binary form
      - HTTP live streaming (HLS)
      - HTTP dynamic streaming (HDS/VOD)
      - advanced http and tcp load balancing
      - session persistence
      - content caching enahnced capabilities
      - bandwidth management for MP4 media
      - live activity monitoring
  - characteristics
    - fast page load times
    - scales well
    - upgrade on the fly
      - update the nginx configuration without bring the service down
    - easy to install, maintain, and use
    - modular design
      - all extensions are built as modules that can be in/excluded when building nginx from source
        - every module that it requires is loaded directly inside of an nginx process
        - ensures that nginx hs a small memory and cpu footprint on the server
    - single threaded
      - does not create a separate thread per request
      - instead relies on events
